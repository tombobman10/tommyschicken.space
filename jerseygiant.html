    <h2>eggs</h2>
    <p>
becuase these girls were built as a meat producer, they dont lay a lot of eggs. you can get 4 to 5 eggs a week. not very many, but enough to make them profitabel. they pretty much dont stop growing,
becuase they were built for growth. they lay nice big brown eggs, and they taste very great. if you want to try one, you can just click 'order'.

    <h2>happy hens
</h2>
    <p>
      as most people konw, happyness is benifical to productivity. it has also been proven scientificly. a study found that happy peope are more productive then there sad counterpart. this study comes from oxferd university. there study is entitled - happy workerrs are 13% more happy. (<a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-10-24-happy-workers-are-13-more-productive">source</a>).
      to keep hens happy, you have to remember a few things. number 1, clean there coop. number 2, give them treats. number 3, keep them safe. number 4, free range them. number 5, clean food and watter. lets start with 1. nobody likes a dirty living space. not you, not hens. hens love having clean straw to lay there eggs in. they love having a house that dosent smell bad. this is
      becuase they roost and poop all night, so there house is constantly in need of repare. number 2,they love treats. hen treats are to hens what cake is to us. the only diffrence is that there treats are alive. hens love eating mealworms. they also love hunting small insects.number 3, nobody likes being stalked by hawcks. not hens, so just keep the big birds away and keep the hens locked up at night. number 4
      free range. hens like fredome. nothing else to say. number 5, clean food and watter. most hens love life. so it makes sence that they would like clean stuff. thats alll the info on happy hens.

    <h2>history</h2>
    <p>
the jeursey giant was originaly created by 2 dudeds who thought that they could overtun the turket market. to do that, they decided to cross black javas, black langshans, annd dark brahmas. the resulting animal was a hulking, huge, creature. the roosters were as big as turkeys. shortly after the animal was added to the american poultry associantion's standerd of perfection. then 25 years later, they created the white veriety. i dont
have the white one, but they sound like a good purchase for the future. they never really took of becuase they grew so much slower comaperd to turkeys. anyhow, there an amazing pet.
