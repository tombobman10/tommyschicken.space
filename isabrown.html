<h2>Eggs</h2>
<p>
becuase these hens lifespan is shrunk down a lot, they lay very consitantly. my hens do 6 eggs a week, witch is a very high rate. if you feed them oats, corn, wheet, and leftovers they'll lay very rich eggs.
as most farm fresh eggs are, thse eggs are dark yolked and creamy. they taste very simmaler to standerd eggs, but the good nutrients inside of them do exist. the biggrest diffrence comes in the the smallest scale.
a study done on all chicken breeds found that hens do better when farm raised (<a href="https://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/eggs-zl0z0703zswa">study</a>). along with that a study on, only,
rhoad island reds found that the eggs from free ranged hens were diffrent, and better. (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22820940/">study</a>). but if you dont belive that, just try some of my eggs. For Science!.

<h2>
happy hens
</h2>
<p>
as most people konw, happyness is benifical to productivity. it has also been proven scientificly. a study found that happy peope are more productive then there sad counterpart. this study comes from oxferd university. there study is entitled - happy workerrs are 13% more happy. (<a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-10-24-happy-workers-are-13-more-productive">source</a>).
to keep hens happy, you have to remember a few things. number 1, clean there coop. number 2, give them treats. number 3, keep them safe. number 4, free range them. number 5, clean food and watter. lets start with 1. nobody likes a dirty living space. not you, not hens. hens love having clean straw to lay there eggs in. they love having a house that dosent smell bad. this is
becuase they roost and poop all night, so there house is constantly in need of repare. number 2,they love treats. hen treats are to hens what cake is to us. the only diffrence is that there treats are alive. hens love eating mealworms. they also love hunting small insects.number 3, nobody likes being stalked by hawcks. not hens, so just keep the big birds away and keep the hens locked up at night. number 4
free range. hens like fredome. nothing else to say. number 5, clean food and watter. most hens love life. so it makes sence that they would like clean stuff. thats alll the info on happy hens.

<h2>
history
</h2>
    <p>
these beautiful creatures originaly come from road isald reds. they were selectivly bred to lay a lot of eggs. an undesierd effect of this was that the life span of the isa brown was drasticly reduced. an interesting fact about this crature is that its very young. it was made in 1997. thats younger then a lot of people. one of the most commen questions is "where did I.S.A come from"?
the answer is Institut de Sélection Animale. wich is frence for Animal Selection Institute. that is the place where the creatures were developed. this comapny is no longer hear, not from bankruptcey, but becuase it merged with merck and co. that formed hubberd isa. then that got bought by hendrix genetics. then that got bought by Group Grimaud La Corbiere, SA. i cant find the trannslatiion for this, so this is the end of that.
